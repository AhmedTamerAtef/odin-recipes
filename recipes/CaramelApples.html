    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>This amazing caramel apple recipe was given to me by a close friend when I was searching for a recipe to make homemade caramel apples for the very first time</p>

    <p>Sprinkle with nuts, crushed cookies, or whatever you desire while the caramel is still warm, but work quickly as the caramel sets very fast.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>8 large tart apples </li>
        <li>8 wooden chopsticks for handles</li>
        <li>2 cups packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 cup light corn syrup</li>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Dip apples in boiling water for a few seconds, using a slotted spoon, then dry with paper towels to remove any wax from the peels. Set apples aside to cool completely, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Insert sticks into the bottom of each cooled apple through the core for a handle.</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Stir brown sugar, sweetened condensed milk, corn syrup, and butter together in a saucepan over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Cook until a candy thermometer 120 degrees C, stirring constantly to prevent burning, about 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove caramel from heat and stir in vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Working quickly, dip each apple into the hot caramel to completely coat the apple and about 1/2 inch of the wooden handle.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle apples with any desired toppings while still hot.</li>
        <li>Let caramel apples cool on the prepared baking sheet, about 1 hour. Use caution, caramel is very hot.</li>
    </ol>
